# Classes

## Creating a Class
class Person:
    pass

clint = Person()

## the __init__ function
- if you have one of these functions inside your class, it runs everytime the class is instantiated.
- class Cat:
    def __init__:
        print('I am a new cat.')


## You can add all sorts of things to a class
- class Mob:
    def__init__(self, name, health = 10):
        self.name

## Class methods can return values outside the class
## A method is really just a function that lives inside a class

## Class Inheritance
- class Hero(Mob):
    
- this is kind of like saying Hero = Mob BUT not exactly
- it doesn't equal it but it copies all its functionality

## Super
- call a function from my parent even though I overwrote it
